        <h1>StarWars.com</h1>
        <p>StarWars.com is the official website for the Star Wars franchise. Founded in November of 1996, it is run by
            Lucas Online, the online entertainment arm of Lucasfilm.[1] The site has undergone frequent redesigns
            throughout its history, often motivated by the current Star Wars film in production. The website's editorial
            team includes senior content writer Dan Brooks and Andi Gutierrez.</p>
        <h3>Origins</h3>
        StarWars.com was launched in 1996 to help market the upcoming 1997 release of the Special Edition Star Wars
        Trilogy. It was the first official movie website to post video documentaries in anticipation of a theatrical
        release, with the multi-part "Anatomy of a Dewback" series. Prior to that Lucasfilm did not have an official
        Star Wars website, instead depending on the thenâ€“Twentieth Century Fox's website.[1]

        <h3>Prequel trilogy</h3>
        Following the release of the Special Edition Trilogy, StarWars.com focused its attention on Episode I, providing
        news updates, behind-the-scenes features and the popular web documentary ("webdoc") series "Making Episode I,"
        which was also known as "Lynne's Diaries" as installments were often introduced by Lucasfilm's Head of Public
        Relations, Lynne Hale. In 1998, when it first hosted the Episode I teaser trailer, StarWars.com broke download
        records.[1]

        After the release of Episode I, StarWars.com diversified its content to include coverage of the Expanded
        Universe and community activities. It adopted its multi-section model in the build-up to Episode II. During
        Episode II's production, StarWars.com posted weekly videos hosted by Ahmed Best from the set of production,
        entitled on location. It also posted a photo or image hand-picked by George Lucas every week as a "George Lucas
        Select." It was during this period that StarWars.com supplemented its online coverage with a biweekly
        newsletter, the Homing Beacon.[1]

        On June 5, 2003, Starwars.com launched an ad-free, paid-access subscription service featuring exclusive content,
        Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club. On April 14, 2003, Lucasfilm entered the direct retail business for
        the first time with the opening of StarWarsShop.com.[1]

        In 2004, with the transfer of the Star Wars Insider license from Paizo Publishing to IDG Entertainment, the
        Official Fan Club ceased to be a licensed property and returned in-house to Lucasfilm, where it became part of
        StarWars.com Hyperspace.[3]

        Right before Episode III started principal photography, StarWars.com introduced a pay-service component to its
        coverage. For an annual subscription rate of $19.99, subscribers would have access to exclusive coverage,
        including daily Set Diaries from Australia, a live webcam broadcasting from the set, online chats, and exclusive
        archival content, such as the deleted Episode II scene "Jedi Attack on the Control Ship" and reprints of the
        original Bantha Tracks newsletter.[1]

        "Ask the Jedi Council" was a section in the official Star Wars website where selected members of the production
        crew answered questions raised by fans. The section was shut down in 2005 and replaced with a "Questions and
        Answers" section that includes all previous "Ask the Jedi Council" questions.[4]
